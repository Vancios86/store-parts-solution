<h3 align="center">Store Solution</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project was created as a challenge during my recruitment process with Mozantech. It is a React interface created with create-react-app, which fetches data from a given API and performs various operations like search by value, sort by type, arrange by price on it. The app is statically typed using TypeScript and includes various unit tests created using Jest framework.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

For this project to run you will this repository cloned to your local machine, as well as the api repository found at: 'https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise'.
To do that follow the steps from down bellow.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and NPM installed. In case you don't here are some useful links: https://nodejs.org; https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install;

- Node.js
- NPM

### Installation

You need to have the repositories from both: the API provided by Mozantech and the React App created by me, downloaded to your machine. Follow the steps down bellow to do that:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to a directory where you want to have the repositories

<code>
  ex: cd C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\Path>
</code>

2. Clone the repos inside the directory of choice pasting the commands down bellow in your terminal

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/vancios86/store-parts-solution.git
```

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise
```

3. Have a terminal opened for EACH of the directories and install NPM packages in both using:

```sh
  npm install
```

4. After installing the dependencies run npm start in both terminals

```sh
 npm start
```

4. Now you should have the app running in your browser on port <code>localhost:3000</code> and making requests to fetch data from the api running on port <code>localhost:8081</code>.
